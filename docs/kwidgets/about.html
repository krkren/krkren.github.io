* What is kwidgets?
It is a widget set for building GUI applications in Kirikiri.
It is a tool for creating native TJS applications, completely independent from KAG.
It is suitable for creating or processing data to be displayed in Kirikiri.

* Who made it?
The main author is yunyundetective.
Seibee-san and Azuma-san are the main contributors so far.
It becomes even more powerful when combined with many plugins created by Go-san.
And above all, it wouldn't work without the Kirikiri core itself created by dee-san.
It is built from everyone's blood and sweat.

* What about the license?
It follows the same license as the Kirikiri 2 core (dual license of GPL and the Kirikiri License).

* What can it do?
For now, if you try running the krkr.exe in this folder, you'll probably get the general idea!

* What's the folder structure?
The files directly under the "data" folder are the kwidgets sample programs.
The files under "data/kwidegs" are the kwidgets core itself.

* How do I integrate it...?
If you run release.bat, release/kwidgets.xp3 will be packed, so copy that to your own project.
Then, you can run the following initialization code from the Kirikiri side and you're good to go.
(The following example is for when kwidgets.xp3 is placed in the same directory as krkr.exe).

   Storages.addAutoPath(System.exePath + "kwidgets.xp3>");
   Scripts.execStorage("KInitialize.tjs");

* Is there no manual?
Unfortunately...
I've included comments with Doxygen in mind, so if you format it properly to look like JavaScript, Doxygen should be able to process it... but I haven't gotten around to that yet.
If someone is willing to do that tedious work, they are very welcome.
For the time being, I'm summarizing the explanations I've tweeted on Togetter.

* Any plans for future expansion?
Since there are parts where the logic is too loose and the behavior is buggy, I plan to fix those gradually.

* I want this feature.
Please consult yunyundetective (@yunyundetective) on Twitter.
I cannot guarantee that I will implement it, but I will look through your suggestions as much as possible.

* I've tried making a new widget.
Please, by all means, let me add it to the core!
