<dt>Q. Why is the name "Kirikiri Z" so confusing?</dt>
<dd>A. Since it is no longer fully compatible with Kirikiri 2 and changes were made to the core components, the name was changed.<br />
It was named by Mr. W.Dee.<br />

"Kirikiri Z" is a confusing name, but I think it's a good name with a sense of playfulness.<br />
<br />
</dd>

<dt>Q. Why did it change to the "Modified BSD License"?</dt>
<dd>A. This is because the "Modified BSD License" is a license that makes it easier to make changes.<br />
Kirikiri Z constitutes a modification under the Kirikiri 2 license, and the Kirikiri 2 license states the following:<br />
<br />
"You may modify and distribute this software, but in this case, it must be distributed only under the same license as this software's license, or a license specifically approved by the author of this software."<br />
<br />
In other words, it is possible to change to a license for which Mr. W.Dee's permission has been obtained. At Mr. W.Dee's request, Kirikiri Z became licensed under the "Modified BSD License".<br />
<br />

<dt>Q. Why did it move to GitHub?</dt>
<dd>A. Mr. W.Dee requested that the current repository be kept only for Kirikiri 2 maintenance, as he wants to work on Kirikiri 3 on GitHub. He asked me to start Kirikiri Z by moving the Kirikiri 2 repository, so it was moved to GitHub.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="ja"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jin1016">@jin1016</a> jin-san, sorry, but could you start Kirikiri Z by moving the current repository to GitHub or somewhere? I'll keep the current repository for Kirikiri 2 maintenance only. I want to do Kirikiri 3 on GitHub.</p>&mdash; wdko (@wdko) <a href="https://twitter.com/wdko/statuses/321595124343775232">April 9, 2013</a></blockquote>

<br />
We planned to migrate to GitHub using the logs from the Kirikiri 2 repository, but during the conversion from SVN to Git, it proved difficult to properly migrate only Kirikiri 2 due to the influence of past folder moves and other factors. Since it became clear that this task would require a significant amount of labor, we abandoned moving all the logs.<br />
<br />
</dd>

<dt>Q. Why did you create Kirikiri Z? It feels like things just got more confusing.</dt>
<dd>A. If you are a programmer, I think you would agree with the goal of being able to build with VC instead of C++Builder 5, but it is difficult to explain the benefits to others.<br />
In short, it's because VC is easier to develop with in the case of Kirikiri.<br />
However, it might not be the case that end-users will immediately feel the benefits of Kirikiri Z.<br />
Kirikiri Z is something where the effects will be felt gradually over one or two years.<br />
Currently, only the programmers developing it feel that it has become much more convenient with Kirikiri Z.<br />
<br />
It all started when I made it possible to build only TJS2 with VC while adding bytecode support to Kirikiri 2.<br />
After that, the background is easier to understand if you read this summary: <a href="http://togetter.com/li/485088">Kirikiri 2 VC Build Support</a>.<br />
