<p>Since questions were also included, I have written answers to them.</p>
<br />
<hr />
<p>
> No mobile support. No track record. Kirikiri itself, even if it's Z, feels old given the current environment. There is no support system.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
> I used it for a Steam port of a game made with Kirikiri 2, but for new projects, I want to target smartphones at the very least, so I'm not using it.<br />
> I think the quality is top-notch, so I would be really happy if it became multi-platform.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
> I am one of those who switched from 2 to Z and currently use it. Thank you as always.<br />
> I remember it being a hassle when I first started because I wasn't used to GitHub and didn't know where "KAG3 for Kirikiri Z" or the DLLs were.<br />
> I think most people's purpose for using it is to switch from 2 (and KAG3).<br />
> So, it would be kind to bundle "KAG3 for Kirikiri Z" from the start for beginners, or have instructions and introductory steps specialized for that...<br />
> I think just clearly separating "Expert items for companies/programmers" and "Beginner items for individual creators" would make it much easier to understand and convenient.<br />

> Google Translate: When using k2compact and kag3ex3 with krkrz, a click/touch check bug appears.<br /> 
> Google Translate: I hope a more powerful adv/novel system that can be used with krkrz will appear in the future! (Supporting FHD 1080p.)<br />
<br />
If you add Window.enableTouch=false; at the beginning, it will always be treated as mouse input, which I believe will solve the problem.<br />
I have contacted the developer regarding this.<br />
</p>

<p>
> I looked into migrating before, but I got the impression that it's not something you can use unless you're at a level where you can "somehow manage on your own."<br />
> Words like "SDK" and "Build" came up when I researched, and I hesitated because I couldn't fully understand them at that initial stage.<br />
> I'm at a level where I use KAG3 as my main and dabble a bit in TJS2, so I'd likely not know how to solve a problem if one occurred.<br />
> Also, because there are few users or the technical level of current users is high, it seems difficult to learn what I want to know in stages.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
> The reason I still can't migrate is that I sensed that the scripts I've spent years making wouldn't be able to be reused as is.<br />
> Since I've built them up like an old family recipe, I don't have the motivation to start over from scratch... sorry.<br />
> Currently, since I stick with BGM and MIDI, another bottleneck was that with Z, I'd have to remake everything or find replacements.<br />
> There was a day I flirted with Tyrano because I wanted to use Live2D, but in the end, I returned to Kirikiri 2 / KAG3.<br />
> If multi-platform support is realized, I will definitely purchase it even if it's paid, out of gratitude for everything so far.<br />

> I tried to go full screen on Windows 10 with the "Gokuen Senshi Mistilteinn Trial Version (ver. 1.03)", but I couldn't.<br />
> There's no detailed explanation regarding WMV and touch panels, so it's hard to understand.<br />
<br />
I have contacted the developer regarding Gokuen Senshi Mistilteinn.<br />
By the way, it seems Gokuen Senshi Mistilteinn was made with Kirikiri 2.<br />
WMV files will work as is if you change the video format.<br />
However, it needs to be encoded with WMV9.<br />
As for touch panels, they are only explained discretely in the API reference, and there's no comprehensive explanation about the touch panel itself, so I would like to improve the documentation.<br />

<br />
H.264 works in vomMFEVR mode, so it won't work in mixer mode.<br />
The publicly available KAG3 doesn't support this mode yet, so to use it in KAG3, you need to modify movie.tjs.<br />

<p>
> During testing, I wanted to use the Kirikiri console window, but with Z, I don't know what to do instead.<br />
<br />
The console window is gone; now when you start from the command line, it outputs logs to the command line.<br />
If you need a console window, please see <a href="https://github.com/krkrz/Krkr2Compat">Krkr2Compat</a>.<br />

<p>
> I'm an Embarcadero believer and a fan of dee-san, so I just drifted along without using it while hesitating. I do think I want to try using it though (*´∀｀*)<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
> I use Kirikiri 2 for doujin.<br />
> For doujin, we often use the menu bar, but Z doesn't have it, so I've been having trouble migrating (menu.dll is deprecated and I hesitate to use it because of operational instability).<br />
> I would be very happy if there was a version of Z that worked just by overwriting the old Kirikiri binary without rewriting the source.<br />
<br />
Complete compatibility at the TJS2 script level is far from our intended direction, so I think it will remain impossible.<br />
We are discarding things that have become legacy, such as MIDI.<br />
Regarding menu.dll, it is deprecated because it hinders multi-platform support, but there is no problem using it if you are focusing only on Windows.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
> I can't get high-quality image interpolation other than bilinear when resizing the window.<br />
<br />
In the multi-platform version, shaders can be used, so it is possible to apply higher quality scaling for the final display by writing the necessary shaders.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
> I haven't touched it since I saw an article before saying it's too heavy to be usable.<br />
> I don't know how it is now, but the group's bulletin board and articles from a year ago are the last things I saw, so I thought development itself had ended.<br />
<br />
Which article said it's too heavy to be usable?<br />
Kirikiri Z is generally faster than Kirikiri 2 in all aspects.<br />
Development is ongoing, and the multi-platform version is in progress.<br />
Because it's a somewhat large-scale development, other updates weren't being done much.<br />
We don't specifically collect or publish adoption records, but it seems at least one game is released with Kirikiri Z every month.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
> From 2, it's almost only improvements for programmatic reasons; it's not smartphone compatible, it doesn't work in browsers, and it doesn't work on Mac.<br />
> That said, I'm very much looking forward to the fact that it's an improvement of Kirikiri itself, not a Kirikiri-like tool like Tyrano!
</p>
<hr />
<p>
> My ideal was "Kirikiri 2 works as is."<br />
> At the very least, I want sample games, tools, and KAG3 to be bundled.<br />
<br />
I think it would have been closer to that if requests had been made during the crowdfunding.<br />
The current specifications are an evolution from the initial requests.<br />
Bundling of samples and tools will proceed sequentially.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
> Can I use Kirikiri 2 plugins?<br />
<br />
Many plugins can be used as is, but plugins using features removed from Kirikiri 2 will not work.<br />
It's faster to actually try running them to check.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
> Low recognition and little information, so I'm likely to get stuck when I have a problem.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
> I considered switching from Nscripter, but since everything necessary isn't in one package, downloading is a hassle, I didn't know whether Kirikiri or KAG was the development tool for making games, there were no samples to use as a model, and the Kirikiri 2 home site was closing at the end of the year, so I gave up on switching.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
> It was announced years ago that Kirikiri 3 would be developed, but it still hasn't been.<br />
> Non-multi-platform support is a problem, but stopping development is an even bigger problem.<br />

> It's a shame because Kirikiri used to be mainstream.<br />
<br />
Kirikiri Z is developed as OSS.<br />
If you submit a pull request, we will review the code and consider incorporating features.<br />
If you find it regrettable, please participate in the development.

> Honestly, I think the biggest factor in whether multi-platform can become mainstream is whether there's an editor like kkde (if there is, I would use it without fail).<br />
<br />
We are also planning to develop a GUI editor for the new ADV engine.

<p>
> In the Kirikiri 2 days, integrated development environments like "Kaguya-hime Studio" were available and made work easy, but Kirikiri Z doesn't have that or it's hard to find, so I don't feel like migrating.<br />

> Not being fully smartphone compatible (iPhone, Android) nowadays is a pretty big flaw. It seems Android development is happening for now...<br />

> Depending on the genre, it might differ, but for me and those around me, the number of free DLs and paid sales on smartphones/tablets is already higher than on PC.<br />

> I would be happy if you could support smartphones/tablets, especially Apple-based ones (where app mechanisms make illegal copying difficult, and both DL and sales numbers are simply high).<br />

<p>
> I didn't know which demographic you wanted to expand to, so I'm sending this as an opinion from an amateur who makes free/doujin games with Kirikiri 2 or TyranoScript: "What would make it easy to recommend to those around me?"<br />
> If this survey was intended for commercial, semi-pro, or higher-level demographics, I apologize.<br />
> I understand it was originally developed for specialists, but considering it's now completely the successor version, I feel it has little to do with most users.<br />
> In that sense, there are many technical terms, and overall it feels difficult to get into.<br />
> For example, for the non-programming crowd, even if they are introduced by a link, they won't know how to use GitHub without looking it up separately.<br />
> They don't use the console either. "What's a command line?" is how they feel.<br />
> In that regard, Kirikiri 2 (actually, Kirikiri 2's documentation is relatively technical, so it's KAG's) felt very much for beginners.<br />
> The fact that tutorials for absolute beginners are abundant is also a big factor.<br />
> Although there is KAG for Kirikiri Z, there is no documentation, so when newly introducing it, what should they look at?<br />
> Regarding the changes page, of course it's about Kirikiri Z, so it's hard to understand for using KAG. (However, I'm looking forward to the new novel engine!)<br />
> Of course, if you're going to make a game, the talk is that you should at least research that much, but the impression is that for a layer that only touches KAG to migrate from Kirikiri 2, it won't go smoothly.<br />

> Personally, I really loved Kirikiri 2/KAG3 for its ease of use, so I'd be happy if Kirikiri Z spreads to various layers like Kirikiri 2 and I can introduce it as "it's easy to use!"<br />
> It's just a selfish feeling.<br />
> Anyway, as a game creator, I'm really grateful that you're continuing development as a successor, and I'm very excited about the novel engine. I'm rooting for you from the sidelines.<br />

> However, it naturally doesn't support the ImageFunction class.

> I think it was a good decision to separate the color correction functions into ImageFunction from an object-oriented perspective.<br />

<br />
In the multi-platform version, shaders can be added freely, so gradations can be described with shaders.<br />
Also, since it's rendered in real-time, it's possible to change it every frame.

<p>
> There are security concerns with Kirikiri itself, and extracting assets or illegal uploading is easy for commercial products.<br />
<br />
The reason cracking is easy is that crackers have released tools that support past games.<br />
If you make changes so those tools can't crack it and build it yourself, the difficulty level increases.
